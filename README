The file "opcodeTomachinecode.txt" stores mnemonic operation codes and their respective machine language equivalent. This is used to create OPTAB while program runs
Assembler Source program is in Assembler.cpp and Loader Source program is in Loader.cpp
The Input file is assumed to be fixed field file that is 10 columns for LABEL, 10 columns for OPCODE, 30 columns for OPERAND
The program is expected to work on a Linux system, preferably Ubuntu 18.04 and above, with g++ version 9.3.0  

Steps to Run:
1.To compile use the command: bash ./compile.sh
2.After compilation, 
    to run Assembler use the command: ./Assembler INPUT.txt
    after running Assembler to run Loader use the command: ./Loader INPUT.txt INPUT_Intermediate

Output Notes:
1.The generated file "INPUT_Intermediate" is the intermediate file generated durring pass 1 of Assembler
2.The final output of Assembler will be stored in file named "INPUT_objectProgram"
3.The final output of Loader will be stored in file named "INPUT_objectProgram_loaderFile"
4.Loader makes use of intermediate file
